# DDLC-BF
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/OpenSauce04/DDLC-BF)](https://repl.it/@OpenSauce04/DDLC-BF)

An attempt to port Doki Doki Literature Club into Brainfuck

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Pillow python library

## Usage:
Open main.py, and wait for it to finish running. This will leave a file called DDLC-BF.bf in the same folder. Run this file in a brainfuck interpreter of your choice to run the game.

I recommend using [this](https://github.com/mrnugget/virtual_brainfuck_machine) brainfuck interpreter, as it is the one that I have been using to test the port.
